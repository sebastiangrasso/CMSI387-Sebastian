Very nice work on this assignment!

Thanks for your feedback on your interests in the class...
I'll try to make sure there is networking and concepts of large
data set transfer as part of upcoming classes!

I notice you are not in a group for your project.  As this is
supposed to be done in groups of three, I'd appreciate it if you
can find a group to work with.  There is one group that currently
only has two people in it:  Will and Nico.  Check with them.

Also, I updated your repo to have the requested structure for the
semester.  Just FYI...
