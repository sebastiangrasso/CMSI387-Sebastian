==================================

Question 1 mutex reversing:          5/ 5 points

Question 2 auditing code change:     5/ 5 points

Question 3 test program:            15/20 points
   You have the test program, but no BoundedBuffer.java file so I can see
      if it works.  Also, you had a compile error in the initial code.
      Sorry, but that costs you points...

Question 4 notifyall() addition:    5/10 points
   The naming convention of the file caused a compile error on the command
      line.  I fixed that for you.  However, there's no main() method so
      I can't run the file to see if it works, either.
      Sorry, but that costs you points.....

Question 5a 2-phase locking:         4/ 5 points
   No, it's not possible.  With two-phase locking, one transaction runs at
      a time, so T1 will run, change both values, then T2 will run and read
      the new values.

Question 5b short read locks:        4/ 5 points
   No, it's not possible.  With read committed isolation, the writes will
      have exlusive locks, so T1 will have exclusive write access for the
      duration of the transaction.  Since write locks are exclusive, in this
      case it's the same outcome as with two-phase locking.

Question 5c snapshot isolation:      4/ 5 points
   Yes, it's possible.  With snapshot isolation, the values are written to
      DIFFERENT locations than the original storage, and then later written
      to the original location.  If T2 reads x before that update write is
      done, and reads y AFTER that update write is done, it would have two
      inconsistent values, the new value for x and the old value for y.

Question 6 virtual address xlate:    5/ 5 points
   Actually the virtuals are 12288 through 16380, but you were only off by
      one, so close enough!

Question 7 calc. explanation:        5/ 5 points

Question 8 loop 4096 analysis:      20/20 points
   Nice write up on this one!

Question 9 fork() tree:             15/15 points
   In this kind of situation it's helpful to use the PID's to help show
      the hierarchy, but you got the idea and the tree is correct.

Total 87 out of 100 = 87.00% which is a B-plus
